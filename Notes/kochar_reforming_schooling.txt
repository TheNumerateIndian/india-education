Notes on "Reforming Primary and Secondary Schooling" by Anjini Kochar
=====================================================================

Summary:  State of learning is dismal.  ASER tests this every year.
Teacher union politics prevents teacher accountability.  Unclear which
policies will improve learning.  (For instance, privatisation of
schools in Chile did not help.)  Lots of data is available, which may
be helpful.

Notes:

* Learning (accumulation of congnitive skills) is weakly correlated to
years of completed schooling.

* India has very poor scores in learning.  These are worse for weaker
  sections (women, SC/STs)

* Scores do not change much across grades.  (Number of class V
  students who can do what class IV students are supposed to is not
  much higher than class IV students --- both are very low.)

* After independence the focus was on just building schools near every
  village.  This was mostly accomplished by 2010.

* The next focus was on providing good facilities (drinking water,
  toilets) and low student teacher ratios.  Data on this is collected
  through the DISE program.

* The third focus was on decentralization, giving autonomy to local
  gram panchayats over schools.  (Started in 1993.)  To measure the
  effect of this more detailed monitoring is required.  So far only
  Karnataka has a reasonable monitoring system.

* To increase demand for schools, mid-days meal scheme was introduced
  in 1995.

* The chapter has references to papers what do some non-trivial
  analysis to see how school location policies interact with
  prevailing caste divisions.

* North India has great shortage of teachers.  So temporary/contract
  teachers are often hired.

* Karnataka and TN are experimenting with activity-based learning
  which mitigates the problems of multi-grade classrooms.

* ASER is doing great work in measuring learning.

* Karnataka's Prajayantra is doing good working in monitoring and
  intervention.

* Teacher unions and their political clout prevent teacher
  accountability.

* SchoolTELLS surveys have data comparing public and private schools.

* School data should be studied along with National Council of Applied
  Economic Research's Human Development Studies Data.

* Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act (2010) may be
  helpful in pushing good policies.
